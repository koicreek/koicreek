## Planned Proof-of-Concepts
- [ ] Rest API – MongoDB + Deno

## Name Inspiration
We were inspired by the simplicity of [Deno Land](https://github.com/denoland), and wanted something equally euphonius and containing a nod to nature. Our love of Koi brought us to Koi Creek!

In Japan, Koi fish are symbolic of good fortune. They are also associated with a strength of purpose and perseverance in the face of adversity.
